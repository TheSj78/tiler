# Tiler

A minimalist strategy game where you compete against an AI to capture the most territory on the board.



## About the Game
Tiler is a turn-based puzzle game. You play as **Cyan**, and the computer plays as **Rose**.
* **The Goal:** Own the most tiles when the board is full.
* **How to Play:** Click an empty square to place your piece. Any enemy pieces directly adjacent to yours (up, down, left, right) will flip to your color.
* **Strategy:** Control the corners and edges to protect your pieces from being flipped back.

## Features
* **Smart AI:** Plays against you using a minimax algorithm (it thinks ahead!).
* **Themes:** Choose between Neon, Toxic, and Sunset visual styles.
* **Customizable:** Change board size (3x3 to 7x7) and difficulty levels.
* **Responsive:** Works great on both desktop and mobile.
* **Offline Ready:** Runs entirely in your browser; no server required.
